# Implementation assignment 1

## Question 1

For part 2 run python q1_2.py housing_train.csv housing_test.csv
It will output the learned weights, training and testing ASE.

For part 3 run python q1_3.py housing_train.csv housing_test.csv
It will output the learned weights, training and testing ASE.

For part 4 run python q1_4.py housing_train.csv housing_test.csv
It will show a plot of the training and testing ASEs as a function of d. ( Note if on FLIP the plots will not show up. See report. ) 

## Question 2

For part 1 run python q2_1.py usps_train.csv usps_test.csv {learning rate}
learning rate can be any float, suggested is 0.001.
The script will output a plot of the cross entropy loss as a function of the number of iterations
( Note if on FLIP the plot will not show up. See report. )

For part 3 run python q2_3.py usps_train.csv usps_test.csv {lambdas}
Lambdas can be a list of any floats, ex 0 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1
The script will output a plot of the accuracy in training and testing for the different lambdas
( Note if on FLIP the plots will not show up. See report. )
